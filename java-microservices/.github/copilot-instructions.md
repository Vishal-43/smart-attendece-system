# Copilot Instructions for Java Microservices

- Project: Smart Attendance System Java Microservices
- Stack: Spring Boot, JWT, PostgreSQL, modular microservices
- Security: All endpoints must require JWT authentication and follow secure coding best practices.
- Features: Student self-attendance (with geofencing/AP), teacher dashboard, analytics, notifications (modular, one service per feature).
- Integration: Each microservice should be independently deployable and communicate via REST APIs.
- Documentation: Keep README.md and this file up to date as features are added.
